MAC Address Formatting Tool

This tool is used to format a MAC address according to team standards (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX). It takes a string of characters as input and removes all dots (.) from it, before formatting it as a string of hexadecimal pairs separated by colons.
Usage

The script is executed by running the following code in a terminal:

python app.py

The user will then be prompted to enter the MAC address they wish to format:

python

What is you MAC Address? 

The original MAC address and the formatted MAC address will then be displayed on the terminal:

less

Original MAC Address: <original_mac_address>
Corrected MAC Address: <formatted_mac_address>

Future Improvements

In the future, the code could be extended to remove any special characters from the input MAC address, not just dots (.).
