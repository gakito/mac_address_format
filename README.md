# MAC Address Formatter
A code to format a MAC address according to team standards (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)

## Functionality
The `mac_modifier` function takes in an input MAC address as a string, removes all dots from the string, and formats it as a string of hexadecimal pairs separated by colons. 



The script is executed by running the following code in a terminal:

python mac_address_format.py

The user will then be prompted to enter the MAC address they wish to format:

python

What is you MAC Address? 

The original MAC address and the formatted MAC address will then be displayed on the terminal:

less

Original MAC Address: <original_mac_address>
Corrected MAC Address: <formatted_mac_address>

Future Improvements

In the future, the code could be extended to remove any special characters from the input MAC address, not just dots (.).
